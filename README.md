# Homeopathy Assistant: Leveraging GenAI for Remedies

## Overview:
The Homeopathy Assistant project aims to revolutionize the way homeopathy doctors interact with patient health concerns by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). Homeopathy, with its holistic approach to health, often relies on understanding the unique symptoms and conditions along with mental state of each patient to prescribe effective remedies. However, finding the right remedy for a patient's specific health issues can be a time-consuming process for doctors.

## Data Collection and Preparation:
To develop the Homeopathy Assistant, a comprehensive homeopathy encyclopedia book's text file was utilized as the primary source of knowledge. This text file served as the foundation for creating a vector database, where entries represent a specific remedy or health concern along with its associated symptoms and indications.

## Semantic Search and Query Processing:
The core functionality of the Homeopathy Assistant lies in its ability to perform semantic searches based on patient health concerns. When a doctor inputs a query regarding a patient's symptoms or health condition, the system utilizes semantic search techniques to retrieve relevant entries from the homeopathy encyclopedia database. This process involves analyzing the semantics of the query and matching it with similar content in the database.

## Answer Generation with LLM:
Once relevant entries are retrieved from the database, they are fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of understanding and generating human-readable text. The LLM processes the input data, contextualizes it, and generates informative answers tailored to the doctor's query. These answers provide insights into potential remedies or treatment options based on the patient's health concerns.
